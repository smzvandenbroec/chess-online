# ChessOnline
## Description
An online Chess game made for the course Web & Database of the TU Delft CSE programme. It was made in a short timespan, which means it doesn't have great visuals and still contains some bugs.

## Instructions
To play, you can either host it locally or join http://chess-on.herokuapp.com/ where is is hosted.

To host locally, open a terminal in the current folder and run the following commands:
'npm install'
'npm start'

You can now join the game at localhost:3000.

Enjoy!

## Known bugs
Complex chess moves don't work e.g. pawn promotion, tower king swap
